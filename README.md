Yo What's up? 

My name is Jaehyeok but you can call me James. I'm going to be a billionaire by the age of 40 and by then I would have achieved the following:

Have close circle of quality friends and families around me
Have wide-range of in depth knowledge about politics
Be the master of Sales and Negotiations
Grown one of the companies and sold for hundreds of millions of dollars still having few companies under my belt
Have become an A-List Hollywood actor and have won few oscars
Have a beautiful, intelligent: socially, mentally, emotionally and sexy caring woman throughout my journey
Have become socially intelligent and can read social cues amongst people and during conversations and is the master of communication.
(There are more, I just cannot come up with it ... I will add more once it comes to my mind)
